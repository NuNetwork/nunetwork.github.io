					<h3>Buying</h3>
					<p><b>Imagine you see a cup of coffee selling for $1.79 US. How much will it cost in NuBits?</b></p><br>
					<p>1.79 NuBits of course. No complex math at the point of sale is needed. Buying and using NuBits at $1.00 US means you will no longer need to keep track of tax gains or losses on each purchase too, unlike other digital currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Dogecoin. Buying products and services using digital currencies has just been made easier with NuBits.</p>

					<h3>Selling</h3>
					<p><b>Thinking about accepting NuBits as a payment option for your store or business?</b></p><br>
					<p>Great idea! In contrast to credit cards, NuBits has no vendor fees and no customer chargebacks. There are even advantages over accepting cash. With NuBits there are no physical transferring costs to get funds off-site. For assistance getting your store set up to accept NuBits, <a href="https://discuss.nubits.com">visit our forum.</a></p>

					<h3>Transferring</h3>
					<p><b>No longer will you need to pay high fees to slowly transfer money to friends and family.</b></p><br>
					<p>NuBits can be instantly sent anywhere in the world for just pennies per transaction. All that is needed is a sender who has NuBits in his wallet, and a receiver with a valid NuBits wallet. Transferring NuBits is cheap, near-instant, and frictionless. Traditional remittance companies will no longer be able to compete with NuBits.</p>

					<h3>Saving</h3>
					<p><b>What if there was an entirely new way to securely store your money without needing a bank?</b></p><br>
					<p><a href="http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2012/04/19/000158349_20120419083611/Rendered/PDF/WPS6025.pdf">The World Bank estimates that half of all adults globally do not use banking services.</a> Of these, “at least 35 percent of them report barriers to account use [...]. Among the most commonly reported barriers are high cost, physical distance, and lack of proper documentation.”</p><br>
					<p>NuBits can substantially change lives for the better. There is no cost to download a NuBits wallet, no physical distance barriers to overcome when sending NuBits, and no documentation required to own NuBits. As the NuBits infrastructure grows, the quality of life for many global citizens will increase.</p>

					<h3>Trading</h3>
					<p><b>Specialized exchanges allow trading of various digital currencies, but there are problems.</b></p><br>
					<p>If traders on these exchanges believe the value of their holdings will go down, they will sell their digital currencies for fiat money such as US dollars. The traders then need to either hold the fiat money on an exchange (which can be a target for theft) or withdraw the funds (which can be slow and inconvenient).</p><br>
					<p>NuBits eliminates this frustration. Traders can purchase NuBits as a stable hedge rather than liquidating their holdings to fiat money. These NuBits can then quickly and easily be transferred off exchanges into private wallets. NuBits makes trading digital currencies easier.</p>
